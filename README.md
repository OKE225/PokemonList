This is a modern and responsive landing page about Pok√©mon, made with React, TypeScript, and the MUI library. It has a clean and simple design that works well on different devices. The app has a main page and a subpage with a list of Pok√©mon. The Pok√©mon data is loaded from an external API and shown clearly. Thanks to pagination, users can see a few Pok√©mon at a time instead of the whole list. React Router allows smooth switching between pages without reloading, making the app easy and fast to use.
